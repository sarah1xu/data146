# Introduction

In the past decades, China economic has grown rapidly. The economic growth did not benefit the entire country but has created gaps in social equality. These gaps in society has led to many problems, and harms to citizens in China. If these gaps does not close, it will only end up leading to more and bigger gaps. The cost for education inequality in China is due to unequal education distribution, which is caused by region inequality, migration, and government policy.  

# Problem Statement (identify the harm):

Education inequality exists within china not simply due to unequal education distribution, but from other inequality gaps. Cities are falling behind with such rapid economic development, and the difference between rural and urban areas in China are becoming more obvious. Bigger cities are more developed than rural cities. Though more people are not moving into the big cities, the hukou policy in China causes the region inequality to still exists. The policy limits what one can do and social benefits it can receive in different regions. Though one might has migrated to a different city within China, their children is only limited to receive education in where there hukou is registered. 

The difference in region also leads to opportunity differences. The different opportunities one can choose from the region they are in. Urban cities has more companies, which has more jobs available. Whereas in rural areas, there is less kinds of jobs that are available. The difference in level of development in both area leads to many different inequality. Income differences, which can impact next generation education. Lower income families might have more difficulty to send their children to school than higher income families.
