# How does Owen Barder define development? How does he extend Amartya Sen's definition to include the idea of complexity?
Owen Barder disagrees with Amartya Sen's definition that development is improving and widing one's choice in life, to improve lifestyles. He believe that development should not only be measured by how one's life has better off, but to veiw development as a property of economic and social system itself. He provided explames by showcasing economic graphs, comparing the ecnomic changes between two countires. He then bought up the question, what caused these changes, the changes that is not shown in the graph. He extended Amartya Sen's definition by applying how human development can lead to economic changes.

# Barder compared the economic growth of South Korea and Ghana between 1960 and 2010.  Why did he make this comparison?  What did this comparison demonstrate when used as the basis to validate economic models?
Uptill 1970, Ghana and Korea income per person difference was low. However, after 1970, Korea income increased repectliy. This recptive growth in Korea's ecnomoy has changed Korean's lifestyle. Owen has said that these economic measurements are not a full measure of one's well-being, which Amartya Sen's argue as the measure of human development. 

# What was the toaster project? What did Thomas Thwaites attempt to do? Was he successful? What is the significance of this example in the context of complexity?
The toaster proejct, when a britsh student tries to build a toaster from scratch. He first bought an toaster to break it apart, knowing the parts that is used in the manufatre of the toaster. As student, his access to many of the materials found in the toaster are limited. Many of the tools he used were replaced by items that could be found in his house. To build an item that cost 5eruo requires many different parts and technology to sucess. Owen argues that a country's ecnomoic needs to be rich in order to supply for these technology and resources in order to make just a simple 5 eruo toaster.

# What was the Harrod Domar growth model? What are the two fundamental variables in this model? Who was Walter Rostow and what was the impact of his work on development?
Harrod Domar, a simple ecnomic model that was used after ww2. The model uses two variable, outcome and capital. Walter Rostow, the cycle that when capital rises, output rises. Which supports the Harrod Domar model that when capital increase, the output also increase. Walter Rostow linked capital and output to higher income, which leads to more savings, which means investments.

# What was the Robert Solow model?  How did it address the limitations of the Harrod-Domar model? Was this model successful at predicting economic growth?
Robert Solow model builds off of the Harrod Domar model, where it has one more varible, a total of 3 instead of two. Robert adds in a third variable, technical. 
Techonology, which can increase firm's output as well as labor. Technology can be used to replace human labor, which the human can work on a different job. With technology, more work can be done at the same time. 

# What was the Ajaokuta Steel works? How did it illustrate the transition from a focus on policies to institutions?  How did Acemoglu & Robsinson's book Why Nations Fail address governance and politics?  How is their argument a response to the previously failed idea regarding engineering prosperity by providing the correct economic advice?
Ajaokuta Steel is a steelwork in Nigera, one of the biggest investment in steelwork. However, this work seems to be a failed attepmt, no steel have been produced. 

# According to Barder, how successful have economic models been at describing and predicting growth over the past 50 years?
Economic models has been improving thoughout times, where more discovery happens and changes our knowledge. With the Harrod Domar's model, we believed think that capital increase equals to output increase. Then we later discover that this model does not always hold true. The Ajaokuta Steel work is a perfect example of when the model prediction failed to hold true. There are many different factors that an economic model does not show, though we are trying to improve economic model validation but there are still many outside factors that cannot be simpily added to an economic model.

# What was the significance of Schumpeter's idea of creative destruction? How does it relate to firms and institutions? What is co-evolution and why is it significant?
Creative destruction as reaching to different and new oppotunites, which firms can use to change their business. Nokia, first thing that comes to mind if theie phones, but Nokia actually did not start off by making phonese. This is an example of how nokia approach new oppotunites, they saw the growth in telecommunications and started to join into the business. As the world are advancing, we need to accept and approach everything differently.

# What is a complex adaptive system? What are some of its important features?
a complex adaptive system is .... which has 5 different features, difficulties to predicit, board predicitions can be made, emergent properties, tends toward great complexity. 

# Who was Haile Sellasie? What is the significance of Kapuscinski's book The Emperor? How did Ethiopia exemplify the suppression of emergent systemic change? Do you agree with this analysis?
Ruler of Ethiopia uptill it was overthown in 1974. Owen uses Kapuscinski to help his understanding of the three countries that he mentioned throughout his talk. Kapuscinski's work helped Owen viewed why development is not shown in these countries, which can be caused by political and social threats that is not shown in economic models. This supports Owen's idea of how economic models hides such factors, and how economic development is not something that can be simply measured. 

# Why does Barder recommend resisting engineering as a policy implication?  What did he mean by iso-morphic mimicry?

# What did Barder mean by "resist fatalism"? Who was Norman Borlaug and what is the green revolution?

# Barder also recommended to promote innovation, embrace creative destruction and shape development.  What did he mean by these recommendations?

# Who was Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen and what was his insight about economic systems and evolution?
