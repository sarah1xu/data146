Perspective Question for Today:

Here are my response from the Blumenstock article 

The promise:
Data achieved from mobile phones can help business make conclusions on customer, these conclusions uses informations from customer internet use. 

The pitfalls:
Data does not always end up in the right place. Hackers can take these data and use it in a negative ways.
Ways forward:
Increase security.

Overall:
The population of mobile phone holders are increasing, datas are being sent out through the use of these datas. No one know actually what data are being collected or when it's being collected. Locations and search history of the mobile phone users can easily be collected without the users knowing, and these information might not always end up in the right place.

Many can benefit from these data being collected, like we can see during this panademic. When you enter into Maryland, you get an alert asking to allow data. These data are used to collect where the user has previous been and can used to match up if they came from high danger areas. (Not exactly sure how it works, but notice I get a alert everytime I'm in Maryland.)

Conclusions made from the use of these datas might not always be accurate, as it only looks at the surface informations and ignore many factor. "Rich are more likely to make more internationl calls during the holidays," this can still apply to customer service workers as they can be contacting their customers for holiday greettings. 

As technology advances, more and more people are relying on mobile uses. However, we are leaving out people and pushing them away espically the older generations. Unlike the younger generation who grew with technology, older generation spends their entire life without technology and it can be harder for them to accept it. For example, my dad refuses to link his cards to apple pay because he believes his cards would be charged without him knowing (card take money when he tap his phone against anywhere).
