Perspective Question for Today:

Here are my response from the Blumenstock article 
 - The use of mobile phones are increasing, more and more people are having accesss to it. Datas sent out from these mobile phones are used across to make decisions. Though it's seem that more people are having access to mobile phones, more people does not imply all people. When making decisions through the use of these datas, we are excluding the ones without mobile phones. Someone who does labor work might not have as much free time to spend on the internet versus someone who might rely on the internet to work.
